### Application Idea
Going to start out with just a calender website where users can add events to the website to keep track of their schedules. The user should be able to input an event name, event date, event start and end time and have it properly display on the calendar. I would like to eventually expand on this if time allows and make it to compare two users' calendar and see if there are overlapping times.
### Functionality
User will enter a page with the current week displayed on the calendar. The user will have the option to add an event by putting in the vent name, event date, event start and end time. For data, I will just use local storage to store the users calendar. Each event is a div tab so I will be storing that in the local storage. I plan to implement a popup that opens when user clicks on an event on their calendar. This popup will give the user to delete the event. When that happens, the event will be removed from the local storage.

I did try to implement another event listener(the popup feature I mentioned above). However, there are more debugging to do on that so it is not shown in the demo.
