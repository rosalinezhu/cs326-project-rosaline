# H2 Application Idea
A calendar website where multiple users can add and edit the same calendar. The idea is to create a collaborative calendar for a group of people to figure out overlapping free time and thus be able to plan out events together. The data this application will be working with is just going to be what the user puts in for the calender they create. Also be working with sharing the calendar to other users via email. 
# H2 Functionality
Users with start with a blank calendar at first. Then, users will have the option to add more users to the calendar by sharing through email. There will be an add button for the users to create an event and place it on their calendar.
